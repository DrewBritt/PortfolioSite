                                    Synapse was built on some of the ideas I had for FlexCave that were outside of the scope of the project.
                                    It serves as a fully fledged student scheduling and grade book system. 
                                    I developed this along with Lyon for the 2019 Congressional App Challenge, in which it placed 2nd for Texas District 31.

                                    FlexCave was an idea brought to me by my computer science teacher on behalf of my principal.
                                    He wanted an up-to-date web app to manage students' schedules during a specific class period.
                                    Working with my good friend Lyon, we completed FlexCave in just 2 short months.

                                    Butting Heads was a comedic top-down soccer game, with the gimmick being the physics were cranked up and the players were heads.
                                    Written in C# with Unity, it was one of my very first coding projects.
                                    It never became more than a rough prototype, but it holds a special place in my heart for the countless giggles it gave my peers and I.
